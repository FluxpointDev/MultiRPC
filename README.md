## Sounds like an epic application! Where can I get it?

## Something's not working!
Contact Builderb#0001 or join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fluxpoint) and we'll help you out with any issue your currently facing!
<hr/>

## How do I use the Custom page?
First you need to create your own custom RPC by going to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications and pressing 'New Application'. 

Once given an name, you copy the Application ID (That goes into Client ID) and upload any images you want to use in the Rich Presence tab. Once done, you use the name you gave the image in Large/Small Key.
<hr/>

## Wait why is the rewrite at V7 when stable is currently V5?
Because we had another version of the rewrite ([rewrite-old](https://github.com/FluxpointDev/MultiRPC/tree/rewrite-old)) which was V6 but that ended up becoming more of a mess then the current stable version so we ended up doing the rewrite from the ground up again.
